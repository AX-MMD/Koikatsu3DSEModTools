# Installation

### Prerequisites

First, you must download KoikatsuModdingTools and the proper Unity version. Follow the steps on their page in the [***How to use it***](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KoikatsuModdingTools?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-it) section, but donâ€™t open Unity yet.

### Adding my tools

Download the latest release on GitHub, then extract it from the .zip, then drag and drop the content into your KoikatsuModdingTools folder. This operation should not ask you to overwrite files, and once done you should have a `/3DSE` folder in `<tools folder>/Assets/Editor`.
